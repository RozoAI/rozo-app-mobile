## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Task: Add a new protected route

**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`

```typescript
// 1. Get your condition
const { showNewFeature } = usePreferences();

// 2. Add to rules array
const protectionRules: RouteProtectionRule[] = [
  // ... existing rules
  {
    paths: "/new-feature",
    condition: () => showNewFeature,
    redirectTo: "/(main)/balance",
    reason: "New feature is disabled",
  },
];
```

**Reference:** [ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#quick-start](./ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#-quick-start)

---

### Task: Add analytics tracking

```typescript
{
  paths: "/premium",
  condition: () => isPremium,
  redirectTo: "/upgrade",
  onProtected: (path) => {
    analytics.track("premium_access_blocked", { from: path });
  },
}
```

**Reference:** [ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#3-with-analytics](./ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#3-with-analytics)

---

### Task: Protect multiple routes with same condition

```typescript
{
  paths: ["/admin", "/(main)/admin", "/admin/settings"],
  condition: () => isAdmin,
  redirectTo: "/",
  reason: "Admin access required",
}
```

**Reference:** [ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#1-multiple-paths-same-rule](./ROUTE_PROTECTION_EXAMPLES.md#1-multiple-paths-same-rule)
